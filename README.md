Welcome to Tiia's Dive Bar and Grill

This is a simple example which demos the use of *ngFor, ngStyle, *ngIf and should help you get started on your Todo Lab if you're stuck. If you clone this, don't forget to cd into the directory and run - npm install - to add the necessary packages in order to run it.

To "order a beer", open the developer console in the browser, and click the button to order one. Cheers!
